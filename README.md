# MoodWatchers

MoodWatchers is an Mobile Application using Flutter and Dart for the SCDF Innovation Challenge. The demo of the app is here : https://app.flutterflow.io/share/kkkk-91x39l

## Getting Started

In order to install Flutter and configure Flutter with an IDE, please follow the installation steps provided by the Flutter Team: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install


### IMPORTANT:

For projects with Firestore integration, you must first run the following commands to ensure the project compiles:

```
flutter pub get
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This command creates the generated files that parse each Record from Firestore into a schema object.
